Automatic migration with grit
You can automatically migrate your codebase using grit, either online or with the following CLI command on Mac or Linux:

openai migrate
The grit binary executes entirely locally with AST-based transforms.

Be sure to audit its changes: we suggest ensuring you have a clean working tree beforehand, and running git add --patch afterwards. Note that grit.io also offers opt-in automatic fixes powered by AI.

Automatic migration with grit on Windows
To use grit to migrate your code on Windows, you will need to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Installing WSL is quick and easy, and you do not need to keep using Linux once the command is done.

Here's a step-by-step guide for setting up and using WSL for this purpose:

Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt as an administrator and run wsl --install.
Restart your computer.
Open the WSL application.
In the WSL terminal, cd into the appropriate directory (e.g., cd /mnt/c/Users/Myself/my/code/) and then run the following commands:
curl -fsSL https://docs.grit.io/install | bash
grit install
grit apply openai
Then, you can close WSL and go back to using Windows.

Automatic migration with grit in Jupyter Notebooks
If your Jupyter notebooks are not in source control, they will be more difficult to migrate. You may want to copy each cell into grit's web interface, and paste the output back in.

If you need to migrate in a way that preserves use of the module-level client instead of instantiated clients, you can use the openai_global grit migration instead.

Initialization

What's changed
Auto-retry with backoff if there's an error
Proper types (for mypy/pyright/editors)
You can now instantiate a client, instead of using a global default.
Switch to explicit client instantiation
Weights and Biases CLI will now be included in their own package
